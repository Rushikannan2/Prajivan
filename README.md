I am passionate about technology and wildlife conservation. This project uses AI for classifying animal distress calls and identifying animal species from audio and image data.

Summary: A cutting-edge project aimed at protecting animals during national calamities using AI, ML, and signal processing. By analyzing animal distress calls, this system leverages drones to deliver timely rescue efforts. The project combines technology and compassion, creating a unique solution to save wildlife in disaster-stricken areas. Join me on this mission to make a real-world impact!
